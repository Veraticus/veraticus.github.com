    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ran into some annoying problems with redis and resque recently that couldn't be immediately solved through judicious Googling, so figured I'd make a quick post about it.</p>

<h2>Resource temporarily unavailable - Timeout reading from the socket</h2>

<p>If you installed redis-rb and hiredis by following the <a href="https://github.com/ezmobius/redis-rb">instructions at the redis-rb github page</a> then you might start running into this problem. Essentially, the version of hiredis they specify (and that you probably installed) is out of date -- 0.3.1 has a known bug with socket disconnects when reading from redis. So happily, the solution to this is pretty simple: just upgrade your version of hiredis. We use 0.4.4 now.</p>

<h2>unexpected token at 'OK' (Resque::Helpers::DecodeException)</h2>

<p>This one took a bit more tracking down to fix.</p>

<p>The newest versions of resque (I'm using 1.20.0) rely on versions greater than 2.4 of redis. Versions below that respond differently to certainly redis commands -- for example, returning "OK." Upgrading your redis server handily fixes this problem.</p>
