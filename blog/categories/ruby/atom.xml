It borrows structure rather liberally from Chris Pine's <a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram">Learn to Program</a>, but the content is my own.</p>

<h2>Getting Started with Ruby</h2>

<h3>Welcome to Programming</h3>

<p>Computer programming is the skill that allows you to make computers do what you want. Computers are excellent at menial, repetitive tasks that require little oversight and no creativity: but you can also use them to make amazing websites, games, and applications. Whether it's a simple program to make your day-to-day life easier, or a complicated application that gives you full-time employment, computer programming is invaluable professionally and also rewarding personally. Even better, it's lots of fun!</p>

<p>Many people are intimidated by the idea of learning computer programming -- they're worried you need complicated math or lots of formal training to do well. Nothing could be further from the truth. Computer programming can be learned by anyone and is very much learning a new language. All you need to succeed at computer programming is familiarity with computers, a willingness to learn, and a computer to do the programming on.</p>

<p>You'll be learning computer programming through the computer language Ruby. Ruby was created with two goals in mind: productivity and fun. While easy to learn, it's also an extremely powerful programming language widely used in the professional world. Some of the most popular websites on the Internet were created with Ruby -- for example, Github, Hulu, and Twitter are all implemented in Ruby.</p>

<p>To learn Ruby, we'll be using an online tool that allows us to quickly and easily try Ruby, called sandRBox. In our first <strong>exercise</strong>, we'll go to sandRBox and type in an example expression.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open up your web browser.</p></li>
<li><p>In the address bar, type <code>sandrbox.com</code>, and press enter.</p></li>
<li><p>In the page that opens, type <code>1 + 1</code>, and press enter.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The output of your command is returned to you immediately. Congratulations, you're a computer programmer!</p>

<h3>Numbers</h3>

<p>Computers are really excellent at math. In this <strong>exercise</strong>, we'll learn how to do math in Ruby.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Try <code>2 * 3</code>. <code>*</code> is the multiplication operator.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>9 / 3</code>. <code>/</code> is the division operator.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>2+2</code>. You don't need spaces around the operator; in fact, Ruby doesn't care how many spaces appear in a statement.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>-9 - 3</code>. By putting a minus in front of a number, it becomes negative.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>9 / 0</code>. This is your first ever error message in Ruby. The kind of error appears before the colon (ZeroDivisionError, in this case); some helpful error text appears afterwards. Obviously, this error means you can't divide by zero.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>5 / 2</code>. It might surprise you that the result is 2 instead of 2.5; what's going on here?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>In Ruby, there are two kinds of numbers. There are <strong>integers</strong> -- that is, whole numbers, whether positive or negative -- and there are <strong>floats</strong>. Floats (short for "floating-point numbers") are numbers with any kind of decimal place, even if that decimal place is zero. <code>55.123</code>, <code>-231.4</code>, <code>0.001</code>, and <code>5.0</code> are all floats.</p>

<p>Most of the time, you'll be using integers. This is because most people (and thus most programs) deal in whole things: you don't receive 4.3 emails, or view 1.8 webpages, or listen to 5.24 of a song. Floats are used when you're doing more complicated mathematics, for example graphics or physics.</p>

<p>In this <strong>exercise</strong>, let's do some math on floats.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Try <code>2.0 * 3.0</code>. Of course, the answer <code>6.0</code> is the same as the answer for integer math, <code>6</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>5.0 / 2.0</code>. Now that answer looks a lot more like what we'd expect!</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>-9.0 + 8.0</code>. Everything you would expect to work in integers works fine on floats.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>(598.0 / (92.0 - 90.0)) * 43.0 + 2.0</code>. Even complicated math is easy with computers!</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Strings</h3>

<p>Numbers are exciting, but people generally use words a lot more than they do numbers. We refer to letters, words, and sentences in Ruby as <strong>strings</strong>. Strings in Ruby are always encapsulated by either single or double-quotes. In this <strong>exercise</strong>, we'll write a few strings to see how they work.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Try <code>'Hello.'</code>. Notice that when Ruby returns a string to us, it's always in double quotes, even if we typed it in single quotes.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>"This is a big fancy string."</code>. Strings can be of any length and can contain any characters: spaces or punctuation included.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>'2 is my favorite number'</code>. Numbers that are in strings are just more words.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>'Well isn't this nice.'</code>. Oh no!</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>"She said, "This is foolish!""</code> What's happening?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>You'll get a syntax error for the last two statements above. In both cases, Ruby is expecting a single quote or double quote to end the string, but instead we're using one inside the actual string itself. Ruby is only a computer language. Unlike a human reading either of those sentences, it can't tell which quotation marks are part of the sentence and which are intended to start and end the string; instead it gives us a syntax error.</p>

<p>Strings are fun to type, but they're even more fun to actually use! Let's do an <strong>exercise</strong> that shows us the power of strings.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Try <code>'Hello' * 3</code>. Whoops, we probably wanted to put a space in there. Let's try it again with <code>'Hello ' * 3</code>. There, isn't that much better?</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>'Message in ' + 'a bottle.'</code> Again, space is important.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>'12' * 3</code>. Is this different than what you'd expect?</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>'12' + '12' + '12'</code>. How about that?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The last two won't actually do math, like you might expect. Remember <code>'12'</code> is a string: <code>12</code> is an integer! So <code>'12'</code> is no different from <code>'sandwiches'</code> or <code>'love'</code> -- it's a word to Ruby, not a number. If you try to use strings as numbers, Ruby won't understand what you mean. Here's a quick <strong>exercise</strong> to illustrate this point.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Try <code>'14' + 14</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>3 * 'bacon'</code>.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>If you think about it, both of these errors make sense. What would it mean to add 14 to the word "fourteen?" How do you multiply three by bacon? Remember, computers can only do what you tell them. If you tell them to do things that don't make any sense, they'll return errors. Still, wouldn't it be nice to be able to add <code>'14'</code> to <code>14</code> and get 28, like we'd expect?</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>What do <code>1</code>, <code>"Hello"</code>, and <code>'My favorite number is 3'</code> all have in common? In Ruby, they're all objects. Ruby objects are very similar to real-world objects. Objects in Ruby can do things, just like objects you interact with every day. A car can drive, a cat can meow, and a person can smile. Objects in Ruby can do things as well; and the things that they can do are called <strong>methods</strong>.</p>

<p>In Ruby, you make an object perform a method with a period, and then the name of the method you want to call. So if you could use Ruby on your car, you would use <code>car.drive</code> to drive it, and if your cat wanted to meow, it would do <code>cat.meow</code>. Let's try a quick <strong>exercise</strong> to see how easy it is to use methods.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Try <code>'Hello'.reverse</code>. reverse is a method for strings: it reverses the string for you. How helpful! In this example, 'Hello' is the object. The period instructs Ruby that a method is coming up next, and reverse is the name of the method.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>1.odd?</code>. Ruby tells you <code>true</code>, which obviously means that 1 is an odd number.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>1.zero?</code>. One is not zero, so Ruby returns <code>false</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>'Sentence!'.length</code>. Length is a string method that returns how many characters are in that string.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>'I want to yell this'.upcase</code>. Upcase transforms a string into all capitals.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>There are dozens of possible methods for strings and numbers. Learning Ruby is very much like learning a new language -- while you will learn the grammar and the most commonly-used words in this class, you'll eventually want to grab a dictionary and look up more words yourself. Ruby's documentation contains a simple, complete, easy-to-read list of methods and is free online. There are instructions for finding it at the end of this handout.</p>

<p>Ruby tries to be as sensible as possible. Methods are named to be unsurprising and predictable. For example, if you know about <code>upcase</code>, you can guess that there's a similar method called <code>downcase</code> that does exactly the opposite -- that is, it would convert all letters into lowercase. And you'd be right!</p>

<p>Because Ruby tries very hard to be unsurprising, there are many methods with the same name between different kinds of objects. These methods generally do the same sorts of things. For example, strings and numbers both have a method that might look very familiar to you: the method <code>+</code>! Yes, you were already using methods without even realizing what they were. Try a quick <strong>exercise</strong> to prove it.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Try <code>1.+1</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>2.-1</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>"One".+"One"</code>.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The plus method is special. You don't need a period before it, but on almost all other methods, you do. It also acts differently for strings and numbers. On strings, <code>+</code> concatenates strings together. But on numbers, it actually adds them. Unfortunately, not all methods are present on every object. Try this <strong>exercise</strong> to get a new, exciting Ruby error that you'll probably see a lot of: the NoMethodError.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Try <code>1.reverse</code>. Whoops: <code>reverse</code> is a method for strings only.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>"Hello".odd?</code> Drat. Looks like <code>odd?</code> is only for numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>"Hello".zero?</code> So is <code>zero?</code>.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>With the NoMethodError, Ruby is letting you know that a method you tried to call on an object didn't exist. You might have the wrong kind of object, or maybe you mistyped the method name. Whatever the case, this is Ruby's nice way of telling you that you messed up somewhere.</p>

<h3>Conversion</h3>

<p>Remember earlier how we thought it'd be nice if you could add <code>'14'</code> and <code>14</code> together to get 28? We now have all the ingredients to make this happen. Ruby has methods that convert one kind of object into another kind of object. In this <strong>exercise</strong>, we'll do some exciting conversions!</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Try <code>1.to_s</code>. to_s means "to string." Notice that the result comes back with quotation marks -- this isn't the number 1 anymore, but instead the word "1"!</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>1.to_f</code>. to_f means "to float." The result is the number 1 as a float -- that is, 1.0.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>2.3.to_i</code>. to_i means "to integer." Because integers can only be whole numbers, the trailing .3 is dropped, converting the number to 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>'3'.to_i</code>. The word "3" is now the number 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>'14'.to_i + 14</code>. Pretty convenient, huh?</p></li>
<li><p>Try <code>'Hello'.to_i</code>.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The result of that last one might surprise you. Ruby tries very hard to perform conversions sensibly, but when it can't convert a string, it'll return zero instead. So be careful of what you're trying to convert, or else you might get zero back instead.</p>

<h3>Next Session</h3>

<p>Now that we've covered the basics of Ruby, we'll put what we've learned into action. Using variables, we'll create our first Ruby programs, and finally make the computer work for us!</p>

    <link href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2012/03/31/ruby-in-the-sandbox-sandrbox/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-31T11:19:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2012/03/31/ruby-in-the-sandbox-sandrbox</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I volunteer in the cyber center at the <a href="http://www.centeronhalsted.org/">Center on Halsted</a>. They're always looking for people to teach new classes, so I figured I would teach an introduction to programming class -- an introduction through Ruby. Besides being my favorite computer language, I think Ruby makes a great beginner's language: it has none of the strange, computer-oriented concepts that make most programming languages difficult to learn, and it even reads like pure, simple English. Instead of pointers and variable typing, you have sensible enumerators and object orientation. And also it's super fun.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, getting stuff installed on the computers at the cyber center is kind of a headache. Like most chronically underfunded but well-meaning institutions, there are about three levels of bureaucracy between you and getting anything done. And teaching Ruby without the aid of irb would be next to impossible. So what's a guy to do?</p>

<p>Simple: <a href="http://sandrbox.herokuapp.com/">create irb online</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Now, I hear what you're saying: "Josh, that already exists, and it's called <a href="http://tryruby.org/">tryruby.org</a>!" Unfortunately, I don't like tryruby all that much. I have nothing but respect for their mission, but the service itself is achingly slow and frequently it won't work at all. I don't know what they're running it on (the only code I could find on github was months old), but I figured I could whip up something better.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Veraticus/Sandrbox">Turns out I was right</a>. Sandrbox is a simple project that I'm actually pretty proud of; it makes use of some very edge-case metaprogramming concepts to create as secure an irb environment as I could whip up. In addition to removing dangerous methods on classes (and their metaclasses), it has some really nice syntactical sugar that makes it easy to understand where you are in a block. And when the execution of your secure code is done, it restores all the classes and methods that were missing while removing any new ones that were added, guaranteeing that your environment will be exactly the same as before you started executing code.</p>

<p>This is obviously important if you intend to run that code on a server somewhere -- after all, you can't have someone doing something like:</p>

<p><code>ruby
`killall -9 thin` # bad
Kernel.exec("rm -rf /") # worse
</code></p>

<p>These methods when executed in Sandrbox are instead gently sanitized:</p>

<p><code>ruby
Sandrbox.perform(['`killall -9 thin`']).output # =&gt; ["NameError: undefined local variable or method ``' for Kernel:Module"]
Sandrbox.perform(['Kernel.exec("rm -rf /")']).output # =&gt; ["NameError: undefined local variable or method `exec' for Kernel:Module"]
</code></p>

<p>While still allowing you to retain the power and complexity of Ruby:</p>

<p><code>ruby
Sandrbox.perform(['class Foo', 'def test', '"Hi!"', 'end', 'end', 'Foo.new.test']).output # =&gt; [nil, '"Hi!"']
</code></p>

<p>Even cooler is that it automatically does some parsing for you, so that you know when code can be executed or the user is probably not done yet typing:</p>

<p><code>ruby
response = Sandrbox.perform(['class Foo', 'def test'])
response.output # []
response.complete? # false
response.indent_level # 2
response.indent_character # 'def'
</code></p>

<p>I put a small Sinatra app in front of this and made a little site that I also called <a href="http://sandrbox.herokuapp.com/">Sandrbox</a>. I intend to use it in place of irb to teach this introduction to programming course -- it'll make a great tool for putting the power of Ruby in front of people while still being relatively assured that they can't destroy my server (intentionally or accidentally). And the code is really pretty neat, so you should definitely <a href="https://github.com/Veraticus/Sandrbox">check out the repository</a>. I can't say that it's totally secure yet, but it's a damn sight better than uncensored irb, and after a week or two of work I bet I'll be able to get it locked down pretty damn tight.</p>

<p>But until then, go ahead and try to break it!</p>

    <link href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2012/03/22/why-i-dont-use-haml/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-22T13:19:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2012/03/22/why-i-dont-use-haml</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I initially thought of titling this post something more inflammatory, like "Why Haml Sucks" or "Only Losers Use Haml." But the truth is <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">Haml</a> does anything but suck. It's actually quite elegant; the syntax is clean, not needing closing tags is just really cool, and it's very fast to read. It seems like it would be an ideal language to replace HTML, just like SASS and CoffeeScript are abstractions of and (to a certain extent) replacements for CSS and JavaScript, respectively.</p>

<p>So why do I bang my head against my desk every time I see someone using it in a view?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Indentation Sucks (Usually)</h2>

<p>Notice the cute little parenthetical up there? That's because I really do like CoffeeScript, which is just as whitespace-sensitive as Haml. So what's the difference?</p>

<p>CoffeeScript uses indentations to abstract away one of the worst "features" of JavaScript: the dreaded <code>})</code> sequences. Closing arguments and functions again and again is not only a headache, it happens so frequently that some sort of error is inevitable. Strict whitespace rules help us avoid errors in closure. Of course, the same argument can be made about HTML and Haml's whitespace rules, but there's another key difference here.</p>

<p>HTML closures indicate which tag they close. You don't have a forest of <code>)})})}</code>, which even if you indent correctly still won't tell you which parenthesis or bracket they're closing. Instead you have an obvious and syntactic declaration of which tag you're ending when you end it. You can argue that the tag closure is unnecessary (Haml seems largely based on this argument), but you're trading explicit tag closure for explicit whitespace restrictions...</p>

<p>And ultimately (and most damningly), whitespace restrictions make the document harder to read and understand than closing tags. If you have an extremely long page with many nested elements, Haml is very difficult to comprehend and consequently much harder to use.</p>

<h2>If It Ain't Broke...</h2>

<p>SASS and CoffeeScript fix serious errors and oversights in the implementations of their specific languages. CoffeeScript ensures correct lexical scoping of variables; SASS allows variable assignment and better selectors than CSS. Both are enormous improvements on the languages they compile into.</p>

<p>Haml doesn't add anything at all to HTML. There's no special Haml tags that do something HTML couldn't do by itself. It gives you a shortcut for the syntax, but that's essentially it.</p>

<p>And HTML really isn't that bad by itself. The syntax is already fairly clean and clear; it's not like we're lost in a field of, well, parenthesis and curly brackets. Tables can get a little muddy at times, but good HTML and CSS prevent documents from becoming unreadable -- and Haml doesn't offer any interesting or unique tools to improve readability, either.</p>

<h2>Designers Aren't Programmers</h2>

<p>But I think this is the biggest reason I don't use Haml. Frontend designers use CSS, and the best ones employ JavaScript (and program good JavaScript!) -- but every single one is going to be using HTML to create their pages. Eventually, if your site gets big, you're going to want a designer to do some pages for you... and they're not going to be producing Haml, they're going to be producing HTML.</p>

<p>Sure, you can change that HTML to Haml. But let me guarantee you, one day they'll want to change something, and at that point you do one of three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Show them the Haml site, tell them to do it all in Haml, and pay for them learning it.</li>
<li>Take their design and convert it to Haml yourself and then incorporate it into the page.</li>
<li>Curse your unjust fate and just switch to erb and copypaste their changes in.</li>
</ol>


<p>As I said at the beginning, I like Haml. But it's a markup language for programmers, and ultimately the people who use HTML the most aren't programmers. SASS is barely a programming language, more like a set of syntactical shortcuts; and CoffeeScript appeals to those who program in JavaScript already. Haml just doesn't appeal to the correct audience to use its core feature set, which is a damn shame, because Haml really is pretty cool.</p>

    <link href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2012/03/16/classifying-and-refactoring-your-code/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-16T00:39:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2012/03/16/classifying-and-refactoring-your-code</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Outside of the guiding framework of Rails, it can be difficult to manage your own Ruby code, as I've discovered in the process of creating <a href="https://github.com/Veraticus/Dynamoid">Dynamoid</a>. MVC provides a clear and concise framework that encapsulates the functionality of most web applications really well; but outside of web applications, exactly where and how to put your code is a lot less clear. I thought I'd share some of my experiences and thoughts on doing this in my own Gem in the hopes that the lessons I've learned will aid others.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Hashes = Objects</h2>

<p>In the earlier iterations of Dynamoid, I was passing around almost everything in hashes, and the calculations I was performing on those hashes was growing more and more complicated as I went, with logic flying around my files like a flock of disorganized birds. When I was putting index logic into criteria chains, I realized that keeping indexes as hashes was an enormous mistake... and one I wish I had realized earlier.</p>

<p>As I was refactoring my code I realized that I pass hashes around in a number of places. Hashes work well initially to store small amounts of data, but if you're using them for that purpose you almost certainly want a real object instead. Just whip that hash apart into a class and you'll be surprised how much code will go in there, and how much simpler your application will be for your trouble.</p>

<h2>Refactor Early, Refactor Often</h2>

<p>I tend to be my own harshest critic, but honestly, my first pass at features tends to be messy at best. I make my tests pass (always test first, btw, but that's so fundamental I'm not going to include it as a point) but usually in the most complicated, slowest, unpleasant way possible. Take some time after the tests pass to stare at your code a bit and decide if that's really the best way to go about doing things. Usually a change will jump out at you immediately, but don't be afraid to just come back to the code later if nothing presents itself.</p>

<p>Tests allow you to do this kind of refactoring free of charge. I always imagine tests as the scaffolding around my code; no matter how tall the code gets, with the scaffolding it'll never fall over.</p>

<h2>Document!</h2>

<p>I'm really bad at this one myself, but I'm going to be going back through Dynamoid in the very near future and adding documentation to all my methods. Even if your code is a one-liner, people will read documentation over code every time. So document that code! Especially in a collaborative environment, documentation is critical for making your project easy to contribute to.</p>

<p>I'm sure other things will pop out at me after some thought, but these are the biggest takeaways Dynamoid has given me. Hopefully they'll be of use to someone else as well.</p>

    <updated>2012-03-13T22:05:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2012/03/13/fnordmetric-native-rails-metrics</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend I spent some time getting <a href="https://github.com/paulasmuth/fnordmetric">Fnordmetric</a> set up in an application. On the surface it looks really cool and quite nifty, but I ran into some trouble getting it configured how I wanted it and figured I'd make a post about it. I think I might have been struggling against the conventions in it a little too much, but it was still an instructive battle.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Engineize It</h2>

<p>The Gem itself assumes you'll be running it on its own port, presumably redirecting nginx traffic there. But this is 2012 and Rails engines are all the rage -- so why bother with a separate app? Well, I'll get to the reason why later, but mounting it as an engine is pretty simple.</p>

<p>Set up an initializer or something that defines all the Fnord metrics you want, something like <code>config/initializers/fnord.rb</code>
```ruby
require "fnordmetric"</p>

<p>FnordMetric.namespace :analytics do
  gauge :events_total,</p>

<pre><code>:tick =&gt; 1.day.to_i, 
:progressive =&gt; true,
:title =&gt; "Events (total)"
</code></pre>

<p>  event(:"*") do</p>

<pre><code>incr :events_tota
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>FnordMetric.server_configuration = {
  :redis_url => "redis://localhost:6379",
  :redis_prefix => "fnordmetric",
  :inbound_stream => ["0.0.0.0", "1339"],
  :start_worker => true,
  :print_stats => 3,
  :event_queue_ttl => 120,
  :event_data_ttl => 3600<em>24</em>30,
  :session_data_ttl => 3600<em>24</em>30
}
```</p>

<p>That stuff is copy-pasted from the Github README, so I won't go into explaining it. Note that we do not include FnordMetric.standalone at the bottom, however; we'll be mounting the server ourselves in routes.rb like so:</p>

<p><code>ruby
  mount FnordMetric.embedded, :at =&gt; "/fnord"
</code></p>

<p>Then you can go to localhost:3000/fnord, and tada! Fnord metrics!</p>

<h2>Set Up a Worker</h2>

<p>The difficult, of course, is that each instance of your app will now also spin up its own instance of a FnordWorker, which might not be what you want. I got around this by altering my config/initializers/fnord.rb:</p>

<p><code>ruby
FnordMetric.server_configuration = {
  :redis_url =&gt; "redis://localhost:6379",
  :redis_prefix =&gt; "fnordmetric",
  :inbound_stream =&gt; ["0.0.0.0", "1339"],
  :start_worker =&gt; (Rails.env.development? || ENV['FNORD_WORKER'] ? true : false),
  :print_stats =&gt; 3,
  :event_queue_ttl =&gt; 120,
  :event_data_ttl =&gt; 3600*24*30,
  :session_data_ttl =&gt; 3600*24*30
}
</code></p>

<p>I know some people hate the ternary operator, but I kind of like it. Anyway, this causes the worker to start only if there's an environment variable set to start it or the Rails environment is development. I set up one instance that receives this variable when it starts, and now I only have one worker. Simplicity itself!</p>

<p>Ultimately, I like Fnordmetric, but I'm not using it in my production applications. I feel like there's a level of abstraction to go before it's really usable in big production apps. It's much better at tracking arbitrary metrics than NewRelic -- honestly, trying to shoehorn stats into their system feels silly at times -- but setting up the tracking stuff is a pain, involving a lot of unnecessary repetition. I think that a Fnordmetric2.0 would be awesome, though, so I hope the project sees more love and work. And who knows, if I have some time I'll try contributing to it myself. That's the joy of open source: if you have a good idea, you make it happen.</p>
