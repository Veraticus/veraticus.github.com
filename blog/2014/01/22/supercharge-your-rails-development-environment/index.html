  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love trying to improve my development environment. Efficiency is important to me: I spend hours and hours a day programming, and even a 1% or 2% productivity boost would provide a massive time savings over the course of a year. Or, as xkcd so pithily put it:</p>

<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/1205/"><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png" alt="Is It Worth The Time?" /></a></p>

<p>Of course, I&rsquo;ve probably obliterated any potential savings by spending so much time experimenting, but now that I&rsquo;ve done it you don&rsquo;t have to! Listed here is everything important to me to get my development environment zipping along. Hopefully you&rsquo;ll be able to find something useful here too that makes your programming experiences a little bit faster.</p>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Font: <strong><a href="http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?event=displayFontPackage&amp;code=1960">Source Code Pro</a> (Free)</strong> A good, clean, monospaced font is extremely important. You&rsquo;ll be staring at it in your text editor and on your terminal, and it has to be easy on the eyes while still differentiating similar-looking characters (l as in llama, 1 as in the number, I as in yours truly). I&rsquo;ve used Inconsolata, Monaco, and Anonymous extensively, but found Source Code Pro to be superior in almost all respects: more readable, more beautiful, less tiring to the eyes. Realistically they&rsquo;re all pretty close though, so just find something you like and go with it.</p></li>
<li><p>Computer: <strong><a href="http://store.apple.com/us/mac">MacBook</a> ($Lots)</strong> Ruby is cross-platform: you can develop on a Mac, Linux, or even Windows if you like. I prefer a Mac. They&rsquo;re extremely reliable, very well-designed, with rock-solid performance characteristics and extremely impressive support guarantees. They really only have one downside, but it&rsquo;s a doozy: the big price tag. See if you can get your employer to buy one for you. Some people don&rsquo;t like OSX, but in my mind it unifies a good user experience with the power of Unix under the hood. There&rsquo;s definitely some stuff about Windows I like more (I have a gaming PC that uses Windows 8), but for development, Macs can&rsquo;t be beat. They also have great, first-class tool support for anything you&rsquo;re likely to do in Rails.</p></li>
<li><p>Shell: <strong><a href="http://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a>, specifically <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a> (Free)</strong> zsh is what bash wants to be. Command completion, sharing of history between shells, spelling correction, amazing prompts&hellip; and oh-my-zsh makes it easy to set up and install. If you need some inspiration for your <code>.zshrc</code>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/Veraticus/8563408">check out mine</a>! My favorite feature is sleeping 10 seconds after you do an <code>rm</code> glob&hellip; this has saved me from my own stupidity more than once. (Lots of stuff from my <code>.zshrc</code> is taken from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/171563/whats-in-your-zshrc">this StackOverflow question</a>.)</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Mac Apps</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword/mac">1Password</a> ($50)</strong> Insanely expensive compared to most other software on this list, but also pretty non-negotiable. I have over 300 passwords stored in it &mdash; including six client logins to AWS, four to RackSpace, and untold multiples for my own servers: how am I supposed to keep all of that straight myself? And generate new ultra-secure passwords whenever I need? Well thankfully I don&rsquo;t have to. 1Password has bulletproof security and I&rsquo;m never concerned I&rsquo;ll lose, forget, or even care about any individual password ever again.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> (Free to try, &pound;17 to buy)</strong> I use Alfred to open nearly everything on my computer. Not just apps! Alfred can open web pages, login automatically with 1Password integration, perform calculations, run one-off terminal commands, find and open files&hellip; Alfred has enormously simplified everything I do with my Mac. Definitely a huge time-saver.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://asepsis.binaryage.com/">Asepsis</a> (Free)</strong> So many important files on your comptuer are dotfiles, which are hidden by default on Macs. So you turn on viewing hidden files&hellip; and suddenly, everywhere you go, you see the dreaded <code>.DS_Store</code>. I hate seeing <code>.DS_Store</code> files. They appear in every directory, they appear on your desktop, they appear in your nightmares&hellip; well Asepsis gets rid of all of them. And it&rsquo;s free.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.macbartender.com/">Bartender</a> (Free to try, $15 to buy)</strong> Look at the upper-right of your Mac. Do you see the volume icon there? The AirPlay icon? Even worse, your own name? (What, are you worried you&rsquo;ll forget it?) Banish the clutter into Bartender and clean up your menu bar: you can hide all the icons you never (or rarely) use, and even configure them to display only when their app does something important.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/">Caffeine</a> (Free)</strong> Prevent your Mac from ever falling asleep. Helpful if you&rsquo;ve ever started a long-running task, left your computer for awhile, and returned to find it had stopped to take a nap.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.getcloudapp.com/">CloudApp</a> (Free, or $4.99 a month)</strong> CloudApp gives you drag-and-drop sharing of any file you&rsquo;d desire. I love having my drops available at a vanity URL (<a href="http://veratic.us">http://veratic.us</a>) &mdash; you&rsquo;d be surprised how many developers say how cool that is, and ask how they can get one of their own. If you don&rsquo;t want the URL then the free version should suit you just fine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://giantcomet.com/flint/mac/">Flint</a> (Free, then $14.99)</strong> I love Campfire and BaseCamp. Flint makes Campfire easy-to-use. Even better, it gives me a badged icon in my dock when people speak, and a growl notification when they mention my name.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://gistifyapp.com/">Gistify</a> ($1.99)</strong> Shameless self-promotion, but I honestly love the app I made for myself! I make gists all the time; gistify gives you drag-and-drop gisting of snippets or files, and allows you to create gists from your clipboard contents. Super convenient and super lightweight.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a> (Free, or $3.99)</strong> The Apple Notification Center is pretty good&hellip; but Growl still seems to be the gold standard for notifications. One of the first pieces of software I install on a new computer. (That said, I have no idea what the $3.99 version does. Growl is one of the few pieces of software on this list I&rsquo;ve never bought.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://hyperdock.bahoom.com/">HyperDock</a> (Free, or $9.95)</strong> Allows you to hover over your dock items and see a preview pane summarizing all of that app&rsquo;s open windows, a la Windows&#8217; default behavior when you hover over an app in the taskbar. Extremely helpful if you have a lot of files open simultaneously &mdash; for example, if you have lots of projects open at once in your text editor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home">iTerm 2</a> (Free)</strong> The best terminal replacement ever &mdash; I don&rsquo;t know how I ever lived with out, and once you start using it, you&rsquo;ll never be able to go back to the default Mac terminal. It has so many nice improvements I can&rsquo;t even list them all, and for the absurd price of &ldquo;free&rdquo; there&rsquo;s absolutely no reason not to use it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html">Little Snitch</a> (Free to try, $34.95 to buy)</strong> Little Snitch is a really excellent software firewall. I&rsquo;m incredibly paranoid about network security, especially on my development machine. Little Snitch allows me to opt-out of connections I don&rsquo;t trust and really lock down my computer &mdash; not only in general, but on a network-by-network basis. As a bonus, it lets me see my network traffic so I get notified if DropBox suddenly decides to resync everything.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://www.monosnap.com/welcome">Monosnap</a> (Free, $4.99 to enable sharing)</strong> The best skitch replacement (since Evernote ruined it). Fast screen or window captures with built-in DropBox, CloudApp, and Evernote uploading for only $4.99. It&rsquo;ll record videos of your screen and even take selfies on your Mac&rsquo;s camera, if you&rsquo;re too lazy to grab your phone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text 3</a> (Free, then $70(!))</strong> My favorite text editor (and I&rsquo;ve tried most of them). Expensive? Definitely. But you get what you pay for. ST3&rsquo;s best feature is its incredibly versatile package system &mdash; there&rsquo;s a package for pretty much everything, and as a bonus it supports most of TextMate&rsquo;s plugins as well. Despite its depth and power, it&rsquo;s still light-weight enough to start instantly and doesn&rsquo;t spend any time doing reindexing or otherwise chugging. ST3 is also cross-platform if you end up doing a bit of light programming on something other than your primarily development machine, which is useful for standardizing your editor everywhere.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://totalspaces.binaryage.com/">TotalSpaces</a> (Free to try, $18 to buy)</strong> I don&rsquo;t like Mac&rsquo;s default Spaces implementation &mdash; four desktops right next to each other means the furthest space could be two screens away, and the widgets view is totally worthless. TotalSpaces lets you stack desktops in a grid and move left, right, up, and down. Now every space is only one swipe away from any other space. As a bonus you can get rid of the widgets as well.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/mac/">Tweetbot</a> ($19.99)</strong> Twitter is actually a valuable professional tool for me. It lets me keep on top of interesting news and developments in the tech world, contact authors of the software I use directly, and find lots of pictures of kittens. But leaving the #kittens aside, Tweetbot is the best app I&rsquo;ve used for twittering. It&rsquo;s fast, effective, and stays out of my way when I don&rsquo;t want it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.uniboxapp.com/">Unibox</a> ($9.99)</strong> I like Unibox compared to Mail.app and Mail Pilot: it&rsquo;s speedy, it organizes mail effectively, and I feel like I have a bit more control of my inbox. That said I haven&rsquo;t yet run into the program that <em>completely</em> replaces Gmail in a browser for me&hellip; Unibox is as close as I&rsquo;ve come and I use it on a daily basis, but if I&rsquo;m searching for a specific piece of mail, I turn to gmail.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Sublime Text Packages</h2>

<p>If you love Sublime Text 3, you&rsquo;ll want the best packages for it too. Here&rsquo;s what I recommend:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/">Package Control</a> allows you to find, install, and update Sublime Text 3 packages. A prerequisite for installing anything else without going insane.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://buymeasoda.github.io/soda-theme/">Soda</a> is a beautiful, functional theme that I really enjoy. I&rsquo;ve tried a few others and didn&rsquo;t find them nearly as compelling (<a href="http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/">SpaceGray</a> is also quite nice, though the syntax highlighting isn&rsquo;t to my taste). Because I find it easier to read light text on a dark background, I use Soda Dark specifically.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/alignment">Alignment</a> makes it easy to align everything properly and make your code nice and readable.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/facelessuser/BracketHighlighter">BracketHighlighter</a> shows you if you&rsquo;re inside brackets (or a block, or HTML element) and where the start and end of said brackets are. Invaluable.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-git">git</a> gives you git integration right in Sublime Text 3, and works great with&hellip;</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.jisaacks.com/gitgutter">GitGutter</a>, which shows in your gutter changes that are waiting to be committed.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/titoBouzout/SideBarEnhancements">SidebarEnhancements</a> gives you tons more options when you right-click anything in your sidebar, including clipboard, move to trash, reveal in finder, open in another program, and everything else you&rsquo;d expect a sidebar to reasonably contain.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">SublimeLinter</a> (and linters for your languages of choice) provides cheap and easy sanity-checking of your code. Now you&rsquo;ll know as soon as you save (or as soon as you finish typing, if you like) if you fat-fingered a variable name.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Useful Development Tools</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> is the best package manager I&rsquo;ve come across. It&rsquo;ll install everything from libxml2 to postgresql from source automatically, helps you manage upgrades from one version to the next, and is fast and performant.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">rbev</a> allows you to have multiple versions of Ruby on your system simultaneously, each without stepping on the others&#8217; toes. If you regularly develop in runtimes other than MRI (I have to do JRuby stuff somewhat frequently, for example) this allows you switch back and forth without going insane.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/burke/zeus">zeus</a> preloads your Rails apps so that tests, the console, and the server all load lightning-fast. The milliseconds you wait for Rails to start now become microseconds, saving you entire minutes per year&hellip; And isn&rsquo;t that really the point of optimization?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot that I missed and some things I don&rsquo;t even know about. If I didn&rsquo;t include your favorite app, Sublime Text plugin, or Rails development tool let me know <a href="http://twitter.com/Veraticus">@Veraticus</a> &mdash; there&rsquo;s nothing I love more than taking a new app for a spin and even adopting it if it turns out to be amazing!</p>
