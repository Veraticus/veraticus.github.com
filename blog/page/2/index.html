  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been using RubyMotion for four days now. I still like it a lot, and I think the coolest thing about it is the rapidly-evolving community around its use. Ian Phillips figured out how to <a href="http://ianp.org/2012/05/07/rubymotion-and-interface-builder/">link Interface Builder and RubyMotion</a>; Alan deLevie wrote a neat <a href="https://github.com/adelevie/ParseModel">connection to Parse.com</a>. Personally, I&#8217;ve been spending the time writing lots of code. I&#8217;ve just deployed my first RubyMotion app into TestFlight and sent it to some testers. Soon hopefully I&#8217;ll have an actual RubyMotion app, which is pretty exciting! I&#8217;ve learned a lot in the last four days of use and wanted to post a few tips and tricks to hopefully make life easier for other RubyMotionists.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Generally speaking I try to stay away from inflammatory posts. But the release of <a href="http://www.rubymotion.com/">RubyMotion</a> has been a revelation to me. I&#8217;ve done iOS programming before, but I&#8217;ve always found it unpleasant next to programming in other languages. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, Objective-C is better than C or C++, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s saying a whole lot.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve spent the better part of yesterday and last night (since RubyMotion was released) giving it a try. After converting two existing projects from Objective-C into RubyMotion, and spending some time developing one of those further using RubyMotion alone, I&#8217;ve come to a number of conclusions about RubyMotion and Objective-C. Ultimately, RubyMotion is superior to Objective-C in almost every way, and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lrz">Laurent Sansonetti</a> must be some kind of mythical otherworldly genius to have developed something at once so usable and so powerful.</p>

<p>Why do I believe this? What makes RubyMotion so superior to straight-up Objective-C?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://github.com/Veraticus/Dynamoid">Dynamoid 0.4.0</a> is a pretty significant improvement over previous iterations of Dynamoid. While the project has obviously always been my hobby, 0.4.0 represents what I would consider one of the first iterations I would use in a real production application. Not because the previous version haven&#8217;t worked &#8211; they&#8217;ve all done exactly what they should do. But now it has the flexibility and options to really allow an application to thrive in Amazon&#8217;s DynamoDB.</p>

<p>What do I mean by that?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I didn&#8217;t make a post on the 18th because I&#8217;ve been in San Francisco at <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/hipstamatic-office-pictures">the Hipstamatic offices</a>, which are totally awesome. The work I&#8217;ve been doing here has taken up all of my time, so I didn&#8217;t even get the chance to start writing a post until today. While I was here, I met <a href="http://lukesbeard.com/">Luke Beard</a>, a super talented designer who&#8217;s been touching up a lot of our sites. For example, the excellent <a href="http://disposable.hipstamatic.com/">disposable.hipstamatic.com</a> site is all his handiwork. I wanted to streamline his development process, so that he could deploy his work without feeling blocked by my (usually extremely full) schedule.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re going to use <a href="https://github.com/middleman/middleman">Middleman</a> to achieve this, in addition to some other nice effects: automatic minification of JS and CSS and smushing of images. Middleman is essentially intended for developers, though; it requires commandline tools that can be fairly intimidating to those who&#8217;ve never really bothered popping open the console before. So here&#8217;s some small tweaks I made to our HTML projects to make the whole process easier on Luke and any future designers we hire.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my <a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2012/03/25/elasticsearch-and-percolation-in-rails/">previous entry on elasticsearch</a>, I promised I would elaborate on testing <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">elasticsearch</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/karmi/tire">tire</a>) in Rails applications. There&#8217;s not really a whole lot of secret sauce to it, but I figured it&#8217;d make a good, quick post with some crunchy code for a late night. While writing, though, I realized I could also talk about a small problem I ran into while using tire &#8211; specifically relating to index regeneration. This isn&#8217;t a major flaw, but it did waste some of my time, so I figured documenting it (prior to fixing it) would be a sensible idea.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hipstamatic&#8217;s Rails application is deployed to Amazon&#8217;s Elastic Cloud, and we make extensive use of Amazon&#8217;s Web Services in keeping it nimble and performant. Last month, I dedicated two weeks to increasing the responsiveness of the application while simultaneously improving its performance. As a result of the changes I implemented, our AWS costs for this month will be 60% lower than they were last month. This is a pretty dramatic drop, and I wanted to discuss the tools and techniques I used to make it happen.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0q2M3B2o1f1D1D451B1S/uptime.jpg" alt="Uptime - 100%" /></p>

<p>Keeping a highly available web application online is no joke. Everything above 99% is extremely impressive; that means that you battled the forces of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_erosion">erosion</a> and probably even deployed some pretty neat features without even a hiccup from your users&#8217; perspective. I always feel great when I get our weekly <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> status report email &#8211; it&#8217;s a good indication of how well I did my job in the previous week. And for a couple weeks now I&#8217;m happy to report I&#8217;ve been very proud indeed, with 100% uptime on the Hipstamatic web application.</p>

<p>How do you achieve numbers like these? Unfortunately getting to 100% isn&#8217;t an easy road, and I want to state up front that I also don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a realistic goal. Issues you can&#8217;t control can ruin your uptime number, and you shouldn&#8217;t feel broken up about that. It happens to everybody. But it&#8217;s always good setting goals that are difficult to achieve, and this one is no different.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s the secret to 100% uptime?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2012/04/03/how-to-refactor-a-large-and-old-project/">Proper Refactoring</a> proceeds apace, but I think in my last post I gave the impression that the Hipstamatic Rails project is inefficient or, even worse, slow. Nothing could be further from the truth; over the course of two years I&#8217;ve been continuously improving the project to be more responsive and much, much faster. How much faster? Well, unfortunately, I don&#8217;t have metrics from the first months I worked at Synthetic. But we were using XML and then plist to generate our responses to the iPhone app, and that process was achingly slow: I would estimate 200ms on average.</p>

<p>Now, take a look at our average response time over the last month.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/1H0v0C420X0a1O3Y2p3Y/Hipstaweb%20-%20New%20Relic-1.jpg" alt="Average response time - 115ms" /></p>

<p>Considering the web of external services Hipstamatic depends on for much of its operation, I&#8217;m proud of our 115ms average response time. Proud but not satisfied &#8211; hence the need for the Proper Refactoring, and I am optimistic that it will lead to a net performance gain for us and our users. There&#8217;s no reason we can&#8217;t achieve 50-70ms response times with better caching and slimmer applications.</p>

<p>Over the same time period that our response time has dropped, our user base has grown exponentially, and so too our traffic. At the beginning of my tenure at Synthetic our site was receiving close to 100,000 hits a day, and nearly all of that web traffic: now <a href="http://community.hipstamatic.com">community.hipstamatic.com</a> sees about a million requests a day, most of that API traffic generated from our iPhone applications. That&#8217;s an enormous amount of growth, and much of that over the course of just one or two explosive months.</p>

<p>Synthetic is <a href="http://heysynthetic.com/about_us/">a team</a> of extremely talented individuals. But as our main Rails programmer and only server administrator, I wanted to discuss the lessons I personally learned in making Hipstamatic&#8217;s web site and web services fast. (Or, at the very least, a lot faster.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Rails application backing Hipstamatic is very, very large. It started over two years ago as a Rails 2.1 project, and has been continuously improved since then &#8211; moving to Rails 3.2, adding in redis and resque, and then adding in elasticsearch. During that time the database has bounced around continuously in size and importance as we move data from MySQL to data stores that are <a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2012/03/25/elasticsearch-and-percolation-in-rails/">better suited for it</a>. And while at the start it handled only contests and submissions, since then we&#8217;ve added in orders, the family album, D-Series support, and even more exciting behind-the-scenes stuff.</p>

<p>And as you can imagine from a project that&#8217;s undergone continuous improvement for a long time, it&#8217;s kind of a mess. A lot of stuff was done without an eye towards our future needs, and, even more embarrassingly, a lot of stuff was done with a future need in mind &#8211; and, of course, that need never materialized, so the code is named or structured improperly.</p>

<p>The temptation with any project as large and old as this is to do <a href="http://chadfowler.com/2006/12/27/the-big-rewrite">the Big Rewrite</a>. I&#8217;ve been involved in a few of those, and my advice regarding them is quite simple:</p>
