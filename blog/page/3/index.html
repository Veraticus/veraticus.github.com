  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been giving a lot of thought recently to working around DynamoDB&#8217;s built-in limitations. Like most good web products (and I do believe DynamoDB is good), it uses a <a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/less-is-better">less is better</a> approach: but in a database, less is surprising and can make it difficult for people to transition from their existing, fully-featured solutions to a cheaper, faster, but simpler product.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I think you can still do a lot with DynamoDB, and I think the key is using tools targeted specifically towards its shortcomings: lack of indexing and transactional support. Today I&#8217;ll talk a little about overcoming the indexing problem, since I&#8217;m still noodling around the transaction issue.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Configuring unicorn for your Rails servers is as much an art as it is a science.</p>

<p>That said, there are some things that make the configuration and setup a lot easier that I wish I had known before I had taken the unicorn plunge.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was analyzing tools to deploy applications into Amazon&#8217;s elastic cloud, I settled on <a href="https://github.com/wr0ngway/rubber">rubber</a> as our EC2 provisioner of choice.</p>

<p>rubber has a lot going for it. It provides simple, close-to-the-metal server creation and bootstrapping; it&#8217;s super easy to start a server with nothing more than:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>cap rubber:create <span class="nv">ALIAS</span><span class="o">=</span>fluttershy <span class="nv">ROLES</span><span class="o">=</span>unicorn
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And bootstrap it with all the software needed for that role with:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>cap rubber:bootstrap <span class="nv">FILTER</span><span class="o">=</span>fluttershy
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Of course, looking at command line magic doesn&#8217;t tell you anything about how hard or easy it is to initially configure, but rubber is also pretty easy to figure out and get running. When you initially rubber-ize your project, you get an entire directory in config/ called rubber that contains all the configuration files, separated by role, that you can browse to figure out exactly what rubber is doing.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to extend, as well. Adding in hubot scripts to automatically start and stop our little Hipstabot was really painless and will make a good future post, I&#8217;m sure. The good part &#8211; for me at least &#8211; is how close it is to the servers and how well it ties in with Capistrano. There&#8217;s no magic going on and there&#8217;s almost nothing to learn: as long as you have an EC2 account, you can set up a server quickly and painlessly with rubber&#8230; but if you know what you&#8217;re doing, it provides an immense amount of flexibility and power to deploy whatever you want in a simple, repeatable way.</p>

<p>rubber isn&#8217;t just happiness and unicorns, though; it has some definite downsides. It seems to have a lot less mindshare than tools like Chef or Puppet, and because it&#8217;s deployed on a per-application basis, it can&#8217;t easily manage multiple applications deployed onto one machine. But despite these problems I like it a lot, and it perfectly suits our present use case.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://github.com/Veraticus/Dynamoid">Dynamoid</a> is (another) gem I developed, but I think it&#8217;s a lot more exciting than <a href="http://github.com/Veraticus/rapnd">rapnd</a>! I started work on it over Christmas but didn&#8217;t really get a lot of opportunity to focus on it again until recently, when work become relatively less busy.</p>

<p>Dynamoid owes a lot to <a href="https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid">Mongoid</a> &#8211; it&#8217;s essentially trying to be for DynamoDB what Mongoid is for MongoDB. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t really do a whole lot of exciting stuff yet&#8230;</p>

<p>But it will soon! The TODO list is particularly exciting:</p>

<ul>
<li>Association magic: The standard fare like belongs_to, has_many, habtm.</li>
<li>Automatic value separation and joining: Values for DynamoDB keys are limited to 64KB, but with a clever framework we can get around that constraint with multiple keys conjoined together.</li>
<li>Automatic key distribution: As per <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/BestPractices.html">Amazon&#8217;s provisioned throughput guidelines</a>, keys that are frequently accessed incur a throughput penalty due to traffic concentration. Dynamoid will distribute keys that you specify across a number of duplicated keys, and will concatenate them together when read.</li>
<li>Not-gimpy finders: Criteria like you&#8217;re used to with ActiveRecord, so that you can do User.where(:name => &#8216;Josh&#8217;) rather than User.find_by_name(&#8216;Josh&#8217;).</li>
<li>Range keys for models and indexes: To support queries like User.where(:created_at.gt => DateTime.now - 1.day)</li>
</ul>


<p>I hope to have time over the next few days and the weekend to continue improving Dynamoid. Watch this space for further updates.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://github.com/Veraticus/rapnd">rapnd</a> is a gem I developed to create a persistent connection through which to pass messages to Apple&#8217;s Push Notification servers. It&#8217;s pretty neat and you should check it out.</p>

<h2>Why another push notification gem?</h2>

<p>The existing ones just didn&#8217;t do what I wanted. There were some that created persistent daemon connections&#8230; but they were only usable with one app, and we have two apps we want to send push notifications for. There were some with multiple app support, but they didn&#8217;t have daemons or they assumed the existence of ActiveRecord. And in my opinion using ActiveRecord to store notifications is pretty dumb.</p>

<h2>Whoa! ActiveRecord is just fine, bro.</h2>

<p>Yeah, I love ActiveRecord. But it&#8217;s clearly the wrong storage solution for push notifications. For every single push notification we send, we couldn&#8217;t care less about the content or whether or not it was actually delivered &#8211; so storing them in the database just built a huge table that we ended up not needing at all. Redis is the perfect solution: it can handle arbitrarily-sized lists, but doesn&#8217;t bother with any significant kind of persistence. Also, blpop made the programming a breeze.</p>

<h2>Why a daemon?</h2>

<p>Well, Apple tells you to do it. But for a more important reason, Apple claims that constantly established and dropped connections to their servers will result in IP blacklisting. I&#8217;ve never actually seen this in practice, but&#8230; well&#8230; why chance it? rapnd uses one connection per daemon and tries to keep it open as long as possible.</p>

<p>So yeah, it&#8217;s pretty cool. Go check out <a href="http://github.com/Veraticus/rapnd">the rapnd github page</a> to see the deets.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ran into some annoying problems with redis and resque recently that couldn&#8217;t be immediately solved through judicious Googling, so figured I&#8217;d make a quick post about it.</p>

<h2>Resource temporarily unavailable - Timeout reading from the socket</h2>

<p>If you installed redis-rb and hiredis by following the <a href="https://github.com/ezmobius/redis-rb">instructions at the redis-rb github page</a> then you might start running into this problem. Essentially, the version of hiredis they specify (and that you probably installed) is out of date &#8211; 0.3.1 has a known bug with socket disconnects when reading from redis. So happily, the solution to this is pretty simple: just upgrade your version of hiredis. We use 0.4.4 now.</p>

<h2>unexpected token at &#8216;OK&#8217; (Resque::Helpers::DecodeException)</h2>

<p>This one took a bit more tracking down to fix.</p>

<p>The newest versions of resque (I&#8217;m using 1.20.0) rely on versions greater than 2.4 of redis. Versions below that respond differently to certainly redis commands &#8211; for example, returning &#8220;OK.&#8221; Upgrading your redis server handily fixes this problem.</p>
