Gistify just keeps getting better!

[Gistify 1.2.0](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gistify/id653231502) is now in the App Store, and features some awesome drag and drop magic. Drag a snippet of text or an entire file onto the Gistify icon and a new gist will be created from your file. The format of the file will automatically be detected, and the resulting gist URL added to your clipboard just as usual. Amazing!

In addition to that big new feature, 1.2.0 features a number of bug fixes and performance improvements: for example, now Gistify will properly start up if you check the "Open at Startup" box, and you can copy and paste in the GitHub username/password fields (for the 1Password or LastPass users out there). Just small quality of life improvements generally.

Interested in giving Gistify a shot? Go [download it](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gistify/id653231502) now! Or if you'd like to demo it without paying the $1.99, just let me know and I'd be happy to set you up with a review copy.
