Today I'm happy to announce the release of my very first Mac App: [Gistify](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gistify/id653231502)!

[![Gistify](http://f.cl.ly/items/2w0L3S1A2y3H2d3S0c14/Gistify-icon-256.png)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gistify/id653231502)

Gistify rather simply delivers the content of your clipboard to GitHub's awesome [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) service. You can select the default format for all gists and override it on a gist-by-gist basis, and the resulting URL is appended to your clipboard so you can paste it wherever you like.

Simple? Yes indeed, but I desperately wanted it. I made this initial version rapidly to scratch an itch I had -- and perplexingly there's not an existing desktop app that seems to do this already. (There are competing apps that paste to other services, but for some reason none work properly that post to Gist.)

In terms of future plans, I already have a new version submitted for approval to Apple! Version 1.1.0 will allow you to sign in to GitHub and create gists under your username: additionally you can toggle the visibility of gists to either public or secret. And in development is version 1.2.0, which will introduce all kinds of new mind-blowing awesomeness.

So what are you waiting for? Get over to the Mac App store and buy [Gistify](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gistify/id653231502)!
