So you want to become a programmer, huh?

Maybe it's because President Obama [told you to learn computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY), and you're not gonna argue with the President.

Or maybe it's because you hunger to make something -- a product other people use -- and you're tired of a job where, at the end of the day, you wonder what exactly you did or why it even mattered. And hey, making software is easier and cleaner than making furniture.

But realistically it's probably because of the money. Glassdoor claims that [software engineers make a median salary of $70,000](http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/software-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,17.htm), which is nothing to sneeze at. Even the lowliest programmers can look forward to taking home about $40k, and if you have a talent and drive for programming, then the only limit to your salary is your ambition.

All well and good. But how do you go from a casual smartphone owner and recreational computer user to actually making software? And then how do you turn making software into real money that appears in your wallet and bank account?

After my [article on consulting in Rails](http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2014/01/14/rails-consulting-for-fun-and-profit/), easily the most-asked question I received was: "How do I become a programmer, and what do I do when I get there?" No one is born with a keyboard strapped to their hands: every programmer you know learned how to do it. I did too. Here I'll describe what I found most helpful for getting into programming, how I'd do it again if I had to, and what you should keep in mind if you decide to set off on the programmer's path. And then, after all of that, how to turn your newly-created hobby into a real, honest-to-goodness job.

## Before You Start

To become a programmer, you don't need a computer science degree, hipster glasses, youth, or even beauty. (You also don't need a particularly strong math background, in case you're concerned.) That said, there are some things you really do need -- if you can't put a checkmark next to these prerequisites, you might want to seriously reconsider a journey into the realms of computer science.

1. **Love computers**. If you can't see yourself working in front of a computer 8+ hours a day, happy as a clam, then I appreciate you reading this far, but this career path probably isn't for you.

2. **Be driven**. The going will likely get tough -- really tough. When doing something outside of your comfort zone, it's easy to get disheartened and lose your way. How long you can stick it out and keep coming back will determine whether you end up with programming as a hobby, a mediocre skill, or a mastery. Unfortunately there's no shortcuts here. You just have to do it.

3. **

## The Finish Line

Still with me? Good.

Before you even set off on this journey, we should consider the end goal. Specifically, what do you need to know in order for a potential employer to consider you a viable candidate for a programming job?

This prospective employer will look for three things when evaluating you for a programming job:

1. Actual knowledge of the programming language. Your employer will vet your technical competency by asking you specific technical questions: for Ruby, the classic chestnut is "[what's the difference between a block, a proc, and a lambda?](http://awaxman11.github.io/blog/2013/08/05/what-is-the-difference-between-a-block/)" Though you'll get bonus points for knowing everything 100%, no one expects you to have your language memorized offhand or even know the minute details of its operation. They're looking for breadth of knowledge, where you'd go to look stuff up if you didn't know it, and a general feeling you've been around the block at least once or twice.

2. Having used programming in a professional capacity. Even if you know your language, you're no good to anyone if you can't apply your skills and complete projects. An empty resume with a note at the top that you love to code -- even if your coding ability is out of this world -- won't get you hired anywhere. The unfortunate reality of the labor market is that everyone only wants to hire proven winners. You have to establish you are one if you want to be employable.

3. Demonstrated ability to work with other human begins. Yes, you want to be a computer programmer, not a diplomat: but you'll probably end up talking a lot to your boss, coworkers, and possibly even customers. You have to be able to put people at ease and make them like and trust you, or else your career won't go anywhere at all -- and you certainly won't make it past even a casual interview.

## Ready, Set, Go!

With no further ado, a step-by-step list to go from zero to hero! If some steps are too remedial for you, just skip ahead until you get to a point where you think it's reasonable to follow along.

<ol>
<li>
**Learn a little about computers**. Yes, you might use one every day and carry one around with you in your pocket. But what do you really know about these mysterious machines that make your life easier? Probably all too little!

Even the computer languages that look very much like English require you to know something about the interior operations of a computer: you don't have to be an expert, but a generalized idea of how things work will be necessary for you to get into programming. For example, if you don't know what files are, what memory is, or how to find your IP address, you should start doing a little research.

It would probably also be helpful to learn a little bit about the structure of the Internet if you intend to do web programming of any sort... and these days, almost everything seems to involve a little bit of web programming.
</li>

<li>
**Learn about computer programming**.
</li>

<li>
**Start learning your programming language**. Now that you have a solid foundation, it's time to start learning your programming language!

There are likely a lot of extremely good resources out there already to help you. I learned from some of the classic books of Ruby programming

Remember to consult the documentation! Almost every modern programming language has extremely extensive documentation, and probably a dedicated online following that love making those docs easier to read and understand. A little bit of Googling on even the silliest questions will probably yield a treasure trove of information... some useful, some not. (Try, for example, "[why is Ruby named Ruby?](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=why+is+ruby+named+ruby&l=1)".)

And while you're learning programming...
</li>

<li>
**Start using it**. It's never too early to apply your skills, even if you feel you have no skills at all! Having a project in mind is great and will help direct and guide your learning. There's no such thing as "too ambitious" when it comes to a personal project -- want to create the next Facebook, manually process credit cards, or keep track of millions of items in a warehouse? Well guess what, computers are great at almost every task imaginable and you're learning how to apply their incredible power to the problems of your choice. Go to it!

Yes, your code will be completely terrible. Yes, you'll probably grow bored or frustrated with the project and abandon it. Yes,

But using your code in a project will reveal aspects of your chosen language you'd probably never discover through a book or a tutorial. This is the sort of battle-hardening that you only really get on the field: you have to be in the trenches to know this stuff. For a Ruby example, you might have to figure out [asynchronous jobs](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) or how to [create QR codes](http://whomwah.github.io/rqrcode/).

Again, Google is your best friend here. One of the unfortunate realities about programming is that someone else has already done what you want to do -- but you can learn quite a lot from their experiences and whatever code they've created.
</li>

<li>
**Use it professionally**. At this point your code still probably isn't anywhere near professional-caliber. Guess what? That's fine! As long as you can still use it to do things -- even if it takes you awhile, or the result is unpleasant, or there are a lot of "gotchas" for your poor users -- you're already a programmer. If you have a job, start trying to work coding into it.

When I was in college I had an internship where I was expected to go over huge CSV files by hand. It was a ridiculously unpleasant job... but a small amount of Ruby and a really ugly [regular expression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) saved me an enormous amount manual parsing and let me drill down to the problem spots immediately. Wen I gave the company my program, they in turn gave me a really stellar recommendation that probably started my career.

Unfortunately, right out of college, all that recommendation landed me was a job doing tech support, but I managed to use my bad programming abilities there, too! The company I was doing support for had a terrible process for dealing with data files -- really big ones, gigabytes large. We'd go on-site, burn the files we needed to a DVD, take them back to the office, analyze them there to find out what was wrong, load the fixed files back onto another DVD, then go all the way back to the client.

I wasn't a great programmer: in fact, I wouldn't even say I was a particularly good one. But I made a little Rails site that accepted enormous file uploads, so we could just upload the file and someone at the home office would download it. It crashed all the time, it took an eternity to upload, and it had the jankiest login system you'd ever seen. But it saved me and all my coworkers a trip back and forth to the office... and it looked great on my resume when I decided to switch jobs.
</li>

<li>
**Use it personally**. You might find yourself doing this as you get even slightly proficient: the adage that [when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument) is very true. But that's not necessarily a bad thing!

When you create a program for yourself, don't hoard it. Release it on GitHub and include some excellent documentation, and possibly even some tests. This is true even for what you'd consider really minor pieces of code -- it'd probably help someone, and having open-source code allows potential employers (and potential clients) to see what you do, what your code looks like, and your process for creating it. More than anything else, GitHub has become my go-to tool for evaluating potential candidates for a position.

I don't mean to scare you away if you intend only to work on closed software, but having even hobby projects makes you look passionate about programming. And as I said, it really gives people the opportunity to vet you.

### What Language Should I Learn?

Well, I like [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/). It's beautiful, functional, easy for beginners and powerful for experts. Professionally you'll use it either to create web and mobile applications (with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) or [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/), respectively). [Python](http://www.python.org/) is also great for many of the reasons that Ruby is.

Lots of people swear by Java, and if you're in a big company it's probably much easier for you to get buy-in for a language backed by Oracle than one created by a bunch of people on the Internet.

If you want to create graphically intensive computer games, you'll want to brush up your math a little bit and check out the grand-daddy of programming languages, C (and its offshoots and derivates, C++, Objective-C, and C#, depending on your platform). C is hard to start with, though, and has a lot of complicated concepts -- if you're just beginning, a language slightly friendlier to humans would smooth the learning curve.
