"description":"Gistify lets you share code quickly and easily to GitHub's awesome Gist service!\n\nGetting content to Gist couldn't be easier. You can paste the contents of your clipboard with a global keyboard shortcut, or if that doesn't suit you drag and drop files or even just snippets of text -- the URL of the gist you created is automatically added to your clipboard, so all you have to do is start sharing!\n\nYou have numerous options for customizing Gistify's behavior. Sign-in to your GitHub account and share either as yourself or anonymously, specify the visibility of each gist you create (public or secret), and select the format of the content you're Gistifying. Set your usual options as defaults and override them on a gist-by-gist basis as necessary.\n\nGistify is the ultimate solution for sharing your code (and other documents and files) quickly and easily.\n\n* Paste directly to Gist.\n* Specify format of pastes by default, and override them on a gist-by-gist basis.\n* Sign in to your GitHub account to create gists with your username.\n* Set the visibility of your gists to either public or secret.\n* Create gists from drag-and-dropped files and text.", "currency":"USD", "genres":["Developer Tools", "Productivity"], "genreIds":["12002", "12014"], "releaseDate":"2013-05-29T06:10:45Z", "sellerName":"Joshua Symonds", "bundleId":"com.joshsymonds.gistify", "trackId":653231502, "trackName":"Gistify", "primaryGenreName":"Developer Tools", "primaryGenreId":12002,
