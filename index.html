  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love Hashicorp&rsquo;s <a href="https://consul.io">Consul</a> and I use it extensively in my infrastructures. I also love <a href="https://mmonit.com/monit/">Monit</a> and I use the two to keep up-to-date on the services running on my servers and remain confident that they&rsquo;ll stay up. Though both products have server dashboards (<a href="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/">Atlas</a> and <a href="https://mmonit.com/">mmonit</a> respectively) it can be very helpful to see the result of checks immediately upon logging in. Something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/2w2G2g1S0E111y0l1Q15/banner.png" alt="Banner" /></p>

<p>After a bit of hacking I set up a little Ruby script that outputs exactly that using the magic of a <code>pam_motd</code> banner, so that when you log in you can immediately see how your system is doing. Getting it going is pretty easy and I&rsquo;ve found it quite helpful so far &ndash; if you&rsquo;re interested in running it as well, here&rsquo;s how!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Compiling software takes a long time. The worst offender, for us, is usually Ruby, but it could be anything &ndash; recently we had a client that wanted to install ffmpeg on each server, with compilation times upwards of five minutes. The answer to getting around long compilation times in a standardized server environment is, of course, packages! So we developed a Chef-based solution to create packages with the really excellent <a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm">fpm</a>, upload them to S3, and then download them on target servers: all without needing anything other than a few gems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Testing infrastructure is as crucial to the success of a business as testing applications. Yet most infrastructure is untested and validated only occasionally, and only by hand &ndash; this is especially a tragedy when chef is used, because chef has many high-quality tools to provide testing coverage from <a href="https://foodcritic.io">static analysis</a> to <a href="https://github.com/sethvargo/chefspec">unit testing</a> and even <a href="http://kitchen.ci/">full convergence runs</a>.</p>

<p>At Symonds &amp; Son, we spent a lot of time and energy integrating our tests on <a href="https://circleci.com">CircleCI</a> into a continuous deployment process that begins with three layers of testing and ends with automated cookbook deployment to the chef servers we manage. I&rsquo;ll discuss chef continuous deployment in a later article; here, I&rsquo;ll cover how we got Foodcritic, ChefSpec, and Test Kitchen all running seamlessly in Circle.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with <a href="http://www.consul.io/">consul</a>. At first glance, it&rsquo;s a bit like <a href="http://zookeeper.apache.org/">zookeeper</a> or <a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd">etcd</a> &ndash; it handles service discovery, health checking, and even features a very simple k/v store. But consul does much more than merely expose a lovely DNS interface: one of its more powerful features is its ability to do cluster orchestration, efficiently and effectively propagating messages to all nodes. One of my client projects runs on a dozen servers across two applications; here&rsquo;s how I integrated CircleCI, chef, and consul together to make any GitHub commit run a deploy only to the targeted application, without needing to know any application server&rsquo;s name or IP address.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So you want to become a programmer, huh?</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because President Obama <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY">told you to learn computer science</a>, and you&rsquo;re not gonna argue with the President.</p>

<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s because you hunger to make something &ndash; a product other people use &ndash; and you&rsquo;re tired of a job where, at the end of the day, you wonder what exactly you did or why it even mattered. And hey, making software is easier and cleaner than making furniture.</p>

<p>But realistically it&rsquo;s probably because of the money. Glassdoor claims that <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/software-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,17.htm">software engineers make a median salary of $85,000</a>, which is nothing to sneeze at. Even the lowliest programmers can look forward to taking home about $60k, and if you have a talent and drive for programming, then the only limit to your salary is your ambition.</p>

<p>All well and good. But how do you go from a casual smartphone owner and recreational computer user to actually making software? And then how do you turn making software into real money that appears in your wallet and bank account?</p>

<p>After my <a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2014/01/14/rails-consulting-for-fun-and-profit/">article on consulting in Rails</a>, easily the most-asked question I received was: &ldquo;How do I become a programmer, and what do I do when I get there?&rdquo; No one is born with a keyboard strapped to their hands: every programmer you know learned how to do it. I did too. Here I&rsquo;ll describe what I found most helpful for getting into programming, how I&rsquo;d do it again if I had to, and what you should keep in mind if you decide to set off on the programmer&rsquo;s path.</p>

<p>This post is extremely long. But hopefully by the end of it, you&rsquo;ll have some clear ideas and inspirations for how to turn yourself into a real, honest-to-goodness programmer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&rsquo;t usually call out articles on Hacker News for being exceptionally silly &ndash; if I did I wouldn&rsquo;t have the time to write about anything else &ndash; but I saw one in particular tonight that bugged me, titled <a href="http://www.andresosinski.com/you-job-is-not-to-code.html">Your Job Is Not To Code</a>. It was filled with the sort of engineering platitudes that one can reliably expect from HN: you must be an engineering ambassador to your company from the strange and incomprehensible Codingverse. It&rsquo;s up to you to interpret and reinterpret the requirements of your project, hopefully better than its stakeholders, and tell them what they&rsquo;re doing wrong. Your technical skills must be married to the sort of interpersonal skills that would make ambassadors and diplomats blush.</p>

<p>This is all bunk.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re an engineer, then your job is to code. Your job is to be good at it. No, more than that: your job is to be <strong>great</strong> at it. Anything less is a disservice to the people who&rsquo;ve hired you and a disservice to yourself. You should work constantly to succeed at your job. Working towards anything else is a distraction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As developers, we spend a lot of time in our shells: making them fast and responsive improves our productivity. I play around with a lot of development tools (as I mentioned in <a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2014/01/22/supercharge-your-rails-development-environment/">a previous post</a>) trying to find the best combination of intelligence, responsiveness, and fun. Recently I was investigating alternatives to <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a>, which is a wonderful set of Zsh packages but suffers from weird slowdowns and, unfortunately, requires a lot of configuration. I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto">prezto</a> and I love it &ndash; originally an optimized fork of oh-my-zsh, it&rsquo;s now its own project, and it is fast, beautiful, and leverages the full power of Zsh. It looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://veratic.us/image/300y2o0a3t03/screenie.png" alt="Terminal" /></p>

<p>You should get it. And when you do, use these configuration settings to make your experience even better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been creating a complicated OpsWorks server setup for a client, as I mentioned in <a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2014/05/09/creating-an-aws-opsworks-instance-store-ami/">my last post</a>, and I&rsquo;ve been really enjoying the process. OpsWorks, while still a beta service, has a lot to recommend itself: it couples the best parts of chef to the power of the impressive AWS APIs. Using OpsWorks, it&rsquo;s easy to make processes that seem almost magical.</p>

<p>How magical? Well, imagine super-fast command line deploys, seamless cookbook updates, great chatbot and application integration, then marry all those things to AWS autoscaling via elastic load balancing. One use case for my client: <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">TravisCI</a> automatically creating servers, running remote acceptance tests on them, then destroying them afterwards &ndash; all while notifying chatrooms of its progress. Now that&rsquo;s assurance your code will work in production! Really, the sky&rsquo;s the limit here for awesome integrations.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned a lot in the process of implementing this setup. If you&rsquo;re looking to give OpsWorks a go for your next project, here&rsquo;s some hints and tips to make get started on the right path.</p>
