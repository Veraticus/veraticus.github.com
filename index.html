  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&rsquo;t usually call out articles on Hacker News for being exceptionally silly &mdash; if I did I wouldn&rsquo;t have the time to write about anything else &mdash; but I saw one in particular tonight that bugged me, titled <a href="http://www.andresosinski.com/you-job-is-not-to-code.html">Your Job Is Not To Code</a>. It was filled with the sort of engineering platitudes that one can reliably expect from HN: you must be an engineering ambassador to your company from the strange and incomprehensible Codingverse. It&rsquo;s up to you to interpret and reinterpret the requirements of your project, hopefully better than its stakeholders, and tell them what they&rsquo;re doing wrong. Your technical skills must be married to the sort of interpersonal skills that would make ambassadors and diplomats blush.</p>

<p>This is all bunk.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re an engineer, then your job is to code. Your job is to be good at it. No, more than that: your job is to be <strong>great</strong> at it. Anything less is a disservice to the people who&rsquo;ve hired you and a disservice to yourself. You should work constantly to succeed at your job. Working towards anything else is a distraction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As developers, we spend a lot of time in our shells: making them fast and responsive improves our productivity. I play around with a lot of development tools (as I mentioned in <a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2014/01/22/supercharge-your-rails-development-environment/">a previous post</a>) trying to find the best combination of intelligence, responsiveness, and fun. Recently I was investigating alternatives to <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a>, which is a wonderful set of Zsh packages but suffers from weird slowdowns and, unfortunately, requires a lot of configuration. I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto">prezto</a> and I love it &mdash; originally an optimized fork of oh-my-zsh, it&rsquo;s now its own project, and it is fast, beautiful, and leverages the full power of Zsh. It looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://veratic.us/image/300y2o0a3t03/screenie.png" alt="Terminal" /></p>

<p>You should get it. And when you do, use these configuration settings to make your experience even better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been creating a complicated OpsWorks server setup for a client, as I mentioned in <a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2014/05/09/creating-an-aws-opsworks-instance-store-ami/">my last post</a>, and I&rsquo;ve been really enjoying the process. OpsWorks, while still a beta service, has a lot to recommend itself: it couples the best parts of chef to the power of the impressive AWS APIs. Using OpsWorks, it&rsquo;s easy to make processes that seem almost magical.</p>

<p>How magical? Well, imagine super-fast command line deploys, seamless cookbook updates, great chatbot and application integration, then marry all those things to AWS autoscaling via elastic load balancing. One use case for my client: <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">TravisCI</a> automatically creating servers, running remote acceptance tests on them, then destroying them afterwards &mdash; all while notifying chatrooms of its progress. Now that&rsquo;s assurance your code will work in production! Really, the sky&rsquo;s the limit here for awesome integrations.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned a lot in the process of implementing this setup. If you&rsquo;re looking to give OpsWorks a go for your next project, here&rsquo;s some hints and tips to make get started on the right path.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a fair amount of work in Amazon&rsquo;s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/">OpsWorks</a>, in many ways an elegant service. Once you have a set of chef recipes provisioning properly, you&rsquo;ll want to create an AMI for the layer in question so that you don&rsquo;t have to wait through a long setup process again. Unfortunately, doing this in OpsWorks can be frustrating since the instructions for making it happen are scattered across <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workinginstances-custom-ami.html">four</a> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-instance-store.html">entirely</a> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/ec2-cli-get-set-up.html#install-ami-tools">different</a> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/set-up-ec2-cli-linux.html">documents</a>. For my own sanity I made a checklist of all the steps necessary to create an AMI on an instance store EC2 server: this is that checklist for anyone else who might find it useful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love trying to improve my development environment. Efficiency is important to me: I spend hours and hours a day programming, and even a 1% or 2% productivity boost would provide a massive time savings over the course of a year. Or, as xkcd so pithily put it:</p>

<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/1205/"><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png" alt="Is It Worth The Time?" /></a></p>

<p>Of course, I&rsquo;ve probably obliterated any potential savings by spending so much time experimenting, but now that I&rsquo;ve done it you don&rsquo;t have to! Listed here is everything important to me to get my development environment zipping along. Hopefully you&rsquo;ll be able to find something useful here too that makes your programming experiences a little bit faster.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my <a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2014/01/14/rails-consulting-for-fun-and-profit/">previous post</a>, I told the story of how I accidentally fell into consulting and turned it into a successful business. But what does a successful consulting business &mdash; specifically, <strong>my</strong> successful consulting business &mdash; actually look like?</p>

<p><a href="http://symondsandson.com">Symonds &amp; Son</a> isn&rsquo;t named to sound cute and hipstery. I&rsquo;m the son; I&rsquo;m in business with my father, and I recently hired my mother to be my assistant and bookkeeper. The company&rsquo;s name is intended to evoke images of traditional, reliable family businesses, where trust, excellence, and a reputation for quality products are their cornerstones. These companies, traditionally centered around carpentry and other hand-made professions, are my models for how to run Symonds &amp; Son. We are, if you&rsquo;ll forgive me using the phrase, a bespoke development shop, where our great output and superb relationship with our clients are our highest priorities.</p>

<p>But building my profession into a company &mdash; and a company with my parents, no less &mdash; hasn&rsquo;t been an easy road. There have been a lot of compromises we&rsquo;ve had to make to get this ship sailing straight. Here, I&rsquo;ll speak to how I made this new parent/child relationship work&hellip; and how I hope to continue making it work for years to come.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>2013 was a great year for me specifically, and my web development shop (<a href="http://symondsandson.com">Symonds &amp; Son</a>) in general. Though I initially fell into consulting accidentally, I&rsquo;ve aggressively parlayed it into a successful business &mdash; and my only regret has not been doing so sooner! A lot of developers I know are on the fence about striking out on their own. I&rsquo;m going to lay out how 2013 changed me from a full-time employee to owner of my own business, and in doing so hopefully persuade a few people that the benefits to being in business for yourself far outweigh the risks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After reading yet another article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada_3301">Cicada 3301</a> on Hacker News a few weeks ago, I was struck by inspiration. If I wanted a whole gaggle of people on the Internet to compete for &mdash; well, for some unknown goal &mdash; apparently all I needed was ciphertexts of arbitrary complexity and arcane places to hide them. Arcane places I had, but what I didn&rsquo;t was a good way to generate all the sorts of codes that Cicada 3301 employed.</p>

<p>So I decided to make it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As an engineer, we&rsquo;re responsible for creating things that people care about deeply. Whether you&rsquo;re programming something as important as a car&rsquo;s operating system or as silly as an iPhone game, our code touches lives. It&rsquo;s no wonder, then, that the people who interact with our products feel strongly about them &mdash; and possibly about us, as well.</p>

<p>This can sometimes be a good thing. It&rsquo;s always touching to receive a heartfelt letter of thanks and admiration from a customer. But much more commonly, you&rsquo;ll hear complaints, demands, and anger.</p>

<p>Under a deluge like that, it&rsquo;s easy to become disillusioned and bitter. I see it all the time: programmers who hide in their shells at the slightest provocation. They make excuses, shift blame, and refuse to own their actions. I think this attitude is ultimately cowardly &mdash; if you&rsquo;re willing to take credit for the good things you&rsquo;ve done, you have to &ldquo;take credit&rdquo; for the bad stuff too. And cowardice of this sort contributes to making bad code, since your goal is no longer to to solve your organization&rsquo;s problems, but to shirk responsibility.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I call coding defensively &mdash; an entirely separate subject from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming">defensive programming</a>. Coding defensively mires you in your codebase. It&rsquo;s hard to go forward because you don&rsquo;t want more responsibility, and you can&rsquo;t go back because it would be admitting error. And it&rsquo;s a self-reinforcing cycle: once you start becoming defensive, it&rsquo;s difficult to stop.</p>

<p>I was a defensive coder too. I struggled to own the results of my actions: I would refuse to discuss solutions in a sensible, level-headed way. It took me a long time to change my approach, and as part of doing so I wrote a list of maxims summarizing how I wanted to think and act. When I feel myself slipping I go over them to refresh my resolve. I&rsquo;m publishing them here in the hope that they&rsquo;ll help someone else as much as they&rsquo;ve helped me.</p>
