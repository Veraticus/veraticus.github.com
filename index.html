  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve worked with a lot of programmers over the years &#8211; some of them super amazing, and some distinctly lackluster. As I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working with some very skilled individuals recently, I spent some time thinking about what I admire in them. What makes a good programmer so good, and a bad programmer so bad? Or, to mangle English a little bit, what makes a good programmer good?</p>

<p>Based on my experiences, being a great programmer has nothing to do with age, education, or how much money you make. It&#8217;s all in how you act and, more deeply, how you think. I&#8217;ve noticed a consistent set of habits in the programmers I admire. More than knowledge of their chosen language, deep understanding of data structures and algorithms, or even more than years of on-the-job experience &#8211; the way they communicate, the way they conduct themselves, and the way they approach programming speak volumes as to their amazing level of skill.</p>

<p>Certainly there&#8217;s more to being a good programmer than anyone can enumerate, and I wouldn&#8217;t judge any programmer solely based on the presence (or lack) of these practices. But I do know wisdom when I see it, and when I see a programmer expressing these traits, I think, &#8220;This person really knows what they&#8217;re doing.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Three months ago, I wrote <a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2013/07/01/sidekiq-plus-houston-persistent-apple-connection-pooling/">Sidekiq + Houston: Persistent Apple Connection Pooling</a>. The code I included there initially worked great but over time all the APN connections I had established would break and not restart themselves appropriately. To correct this issue, I wrapped the APN connection itself in a class that was more resistant to failure. To help those who are using Sidekiq and Houston together in production, here&#8217;s the code I used to do so.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I&#8217;ve been using <a href="https://github.com/sprinkle-tool/sprinkle">sprinkle</a> a lot in a large client project. Sprinkle is server provisioning software, akin to <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a> except much lighter. It&#8217;s most directly akin to <a href="https://github.com/rubber/rubber">rubber</a>, but rubber&#8217;s biggest advantage is its pre-built recipes: it&#8217;s a little finicky to sensibly extend, and those only work well on EC2. Sprinkle is built for extension, customizability, and platform agnosticism, but comes with no recipes at all by default. Tradeoffs!</p>

<p>Sprinkle (and rubber) are very different from most other server provisioning software I&#8217;ve used &#8211; on the one hand, by leveraging Capistrano for server communication (or SSH or Vlad if you prefer), it remains extremely light and focused on just provisioning. But on the other, it inherits most of Capistrano&#8217;s downsides too: primary among them is that it&#8217;s easy to repeat yourself if you&#8217;re not careful. So I wanted to post a quick tip for other people using sprinkle on how to DRY it up just a little bit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Gistify just keeps getting better!</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gistify/id653231502">Gistify 1.2.0</a> is now in the App Store, and features some awesome drag and drop magic. Drag a snippet of text or an entire file onto the Gistify icon and a new gist will be created from your file. The format of the file will automatically be detected, and the resulting gist URL added to your clipboard just as usual. Amazing!</p>

<p>In addition to that big new feature, 1.2.0 features a number of bug fixes and performance improvements: for example, now Gistify will properly start up if you check the &#8220;Open at Startup&#8221; box, and you can copy and paste in the GitHub username/password fields (for the 1Password or LastPass users out there). Just small quality of life improvements generally.</p>

<p>Interested in giving Gistify a shot? Go <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gistify/id653231502">download it</a> now! Or if you&#8217;d like to demo it without paying the $1.99, just let me know and I&#8217;d be happy to set you up with a review copy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My <a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2013/06/26/why-im-not-using-rubymotion-in-production/">last post on RubyMotion</a> generated quite a lot of interest, and I&#8217;ve been asked a few times for my opinion on the recent RubyMotion bugfixes (like correcting <a href="http://hipbyte.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issue/RM-3">RM-3</a> and <a href="http://hipbyte.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issue/RM-32">RM-32</a>). I thought it sensible to revisit this issue a month later to discuss the changes the HipByte team has been making and what they mean for the future of the RubyMotion project.</p>

<p>Having not updated <a href="http://github.com/Veraticus/rapnd">rapnd</a> in a good long while, I was looking for well-supported, up-to-date solution for persisting long-running connections to Apple&#8217;s push notification service through a worker.

<p>I&#8217;m a big proponent of RubyMotion &#8211; a year and a month ago, I wrote an article titled &#8221;<a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2012/05/04/why-rubymotion-is-better-than-objective-c/">Why RubyMotion is Better Than Objective-C</a>&#8221; and despite its divisiveness I still stand behind the points I made. Recently I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of OSX and iOS coding, coming out with a <a href="http://gistifyapp.com">Mac app</a> and working on a new iPhone app for a client. For both projects, though I initially evaluated RubyMotion, I ended up settling on using Objective-C. Given that my blog post is frequently cited as a reason to adopt RubyMotion, after more than a year of its use, I wanted to weigh in on why I believe it isn&#8217;t an appropriate choice for production applications.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I heard an argument recently that the data collected by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)">PRISM</a> was safe from abuse because if the government had the technical expertise to gather the data, it had the competency to secure it as well. While on the face of it this statement is flatly absurd, its derivatives can seem plausible:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;The data is only used if a court approves.&#8221; (The fallacious assumption being that the government can reasonably control access to the PRISM data.)</li>
<li>&#8220;The government is trying to protect us by safeguarding this information in one place.&#8221; (Of course, the idea that this centralized database&#8217;s existence has made said data <strong>more</strong> secure is preposterous.)</li>
<li>&#8220;You had no assurance of privacy on the Internet anyway, so why should this bother you?&#8221; (Because while I can take reasonable steps to make my own data secure, once it&#8217;s in the government&#8217;s hands it&#8217;s their responsibility, and, as should be abundantly obvious, leaks happen.)</li>
</ul>


<p>It&#8217;s easy to believe that a government agency capable of collecting this information and then keeping its existence a secret for so long must have a way of keeping it safe. Unfortunately, the access that was given to the NSA to take this information has no correlation to the skills necessary to secure it; and the very fact of PRISM&#8217;s existence will probably prove too enticing a target to remain secure for very long.</p>

<p>Essentially, the argument as I heard it can be expressed as a simple question: if the government is savvy enough to gather the data, surely they&#8217;re not incompetent enough to lose it? Unfortunately, big brother can indeed be both savvy and incompetent. I think this is the greatest danger to the data PRISM allows access to &#8211; not improper use or excessive domestic surveillance, but complete and outright theft.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hot on the heels of my <a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2013/05/29/gistify-a-mac-app-for-easy-gists/">previous announcement</a>, I&#8217;m proud to announce the release of Gistify version 1.1.0. And after submitting only four days ago &#8211; man, the Mac App store moves incredibly fast compared to the iOS App Store!</p>

<p>Anyhow, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gistify/id653231502">Gistify</a>, the incredibly awesome Mac App that lets you gist quickly and easily, just got a whole lot better. Now you can sign in to your GitHub account to make gists, and set the visibility of your gists to either public or private Also the app screenshots are no longer quite so, well&#8230; drab, for lack of a better word.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t downloaded <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gistify/id653231502">Gistify</a> yet, you should. While I&#8217;m slightly biased, I&#8217;ve been using it all the time and I think it&#8217;s an incredibly handy tool &#8211; after all, that&#8217;s why I released it. But if you&#8217;re not convinced yet, or you&#8217;re just interested in giving it a shot without paying the $2, let me know and I&#8217;ll be happy to hook you up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I&#8217;m happy to announce the release of my very first Mac App: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gistify/id653231502">Gistify</a>!</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gistify/id653231502"><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2w0L3S1A2y3H2d3S0c14/Gistify-icon-256.png" alt="Gistify" /></a></p>

<p>Gistify rather simply delivers the content of your clipboard to GitHub&#8217;s awesome <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a> service. You can select the default format for all gists and override it on a gist-by-gist basis, and the resulting URL is appended to your clipboard so you can paste it wherever you like.</p>

<p>Simple? Yes indeed, but I desperately wanted it. I made this initial version rapidly to scratch an itch I had &#8211; and perplexingly there&#8217;s not an existing desktop app that seems to do this already. (There are competing apps that paste to other services, but for some reason none work properly that post to Gist.)</p>

<p>In terms of future plans, I already have a new version submitted for approval to Apple! Version 1.1.0 will allow you to sign in to GitHub and create gists under your username: additionally you can toggle the visibility of gists to either public or secret. And in development is version 1.2.0, which will introduce all kinds of new mind-blowing awesomeness.</p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? Get over to the Mac App store and buy <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gistify/id653231502">Gistify</a>!</p>

<p>(Oh, and if you like the icon, it&#8217;s by the super amazing <a href="http://twitter.com/lukesbeard">Luke Beard</a>.)</p>
