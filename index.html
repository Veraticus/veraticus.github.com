  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been looking about two weeks now for a really fantastic designer for GirlsGuideTo &#8211; a designer that&#8217;s as fabulous as the site itself. Somewhat surprisingly, given how many people are unemployed or underemployed, my search has been really difficult. And not because of a dearth of responses: in fact, quite the opposite. I estimate I&#8217;ve received more than a hundred resumes in response to Craigslist postings, LinkedIn listings, and advertising in Dribbbble. And most surprising to me is the fact that the vast majority of these responses just aren&#8217;t very good.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure that many of these resumes and coverletters come from experienced, seasoned professionals with a genuine and burning desire to be paid &#8211; a desire that is equally matched by my hunger to pay them for the amazing work they can do. But frankly, you wouldn&#8217;t know it from reading their letters. 99.9% of them are just&#8230; <em>bad</em>. So, I&#8217;ve taken the time to distill the mountain of resumes in my inbox into three succinct lessons. If you&#8217;re going to apply for a job, please take them to heart before writing your potential employer. Not only will you increase the chances you&#8217;ll actually be hired, but they will definitely thank you for breaking the tide of mediocrity that is surely washing over them. If you&#8217;re the one to stand out, believe me&#8230; you&#8217;ll get noticed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Designing a new site from scratch can be difficult &#8211; not technically, but from a usability perspective. What color will your users like best? How big should your buttons be? Where should advertising be placed? Of course, there are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758">amazing usability books</a> out there, but there are some questions you can only answer through experience. Of course, designing for usability should be one of our top priorities &#8211; and here are three cute little libraries that will help you make your sites awesome, beautiful, and most importantly, usable for your users.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s been <a href="http://justcramer.com/2012/06/02/the-cloud-is-not-for-you/">some</a> <a href="http://rdegges.com/heroku-isnt-for-idiots">discussion</a> recently about the relative merits of <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>. I&#8217;ve managed applications both inside Heroku and outside it, and personally speaking, I just can&#8217;t decide whether or not I like the web&#8217;s premier platform-as-a-service or not. Every now and again I&#8217;ll gnash my teeth in frustration over it, and then other times I&#8217;ll sigh dreamily and think of all the wonderful things Heroku has done for me &#8211; and indeed, for the world. So I jotted down a quick list of pros and cons that I think everyone considering Heroku should know; then, at least, you can make an informed decision as to whether or not it&#8217;s right for you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love Rails&#8217; routing system. Quickly and easily connecting English-readable URLs to complicated web actions is one of the joys of working in one of the coolest web frameworks on the Internet. At Synthetic, we&#8217;re ramping up to get a new site out, and as part of the push for that I implemented some cool dynamic routing. I wanted to briefly summarize how and why I went with the routing choices I did, to illustrate using routes expressively and, hopefully, easily.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My first RubyMotion application is rapidly nearing completion. As it involves user preferences that have to be stored both locally and remotely, I was investigating the available Rails gems for user preferences and really didn&#8217;t like what was presently out there. I don&#8217;t really have time to maintain another gem, but maybe someone else has run into this problem and wants a quick and easy solution for creating user preferences. If so, then this code&#8217;s for you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time talking about RubyMotion recently, and I was intending to post the second in my <a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2012/04/24/introduction-to-programming-i/">Introduction to Programming</a> series today to give the whole Motion thing a break. But I spent far too long on Tuesday getting an app correctly deploying through Testflight, and it was a really painful process. I took copious notes while making it happen, though, so in the interest of saving someone else&#8217;s time, here is my step-by-step guide to successfully getting an app from your RubyMotion simulator onto someone else&#8217;s device.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been using RubyMotion for four days now. I still like it a lot, and I think the coolest thing about it is the rapidly-evolving community around its use. Ian Phillips figured out how to <a href="http://ianp.org/2012/05/07/rubymotion-and-interface-builder/">link Interface Builder and RubyMotion</a>; Alan deLevie wrote a neat <a href="https://github.com/adelevie/ParseModel">connection to Parse.com</a>. Personally, I&#8217;ve been spending the time writing lots of code. I&#8217;ve just deployed my first RubyMotion app into TestFlight and sent it to some testers. Soon hopefully I&#8217;ll have an actual RubyMotion app, which is pretty exciting! I&#8217;ve learned a lot in the last four days of use and wanted to post a few tips and tricks to hopefully make life easier for other RubyMotionists.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Generally speaking I try to stay away from inflammatory posts. But the release of <a href="http://www.rubymotion.com/">RubyMotion</a> has been a revelation to me. I&#8217;ve done iOS programming before, but I&#8217;ve always found it unpleasant next to programming in other languages. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, Objective-C is better than C or C++, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s saying a whole lot.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve spent the better part of yesterday and last night (since RubyMotion was released) giving it a try. After converting two existing projects from Objective-C into RubyMotion, and spending some time developing one of those further using RubyMotion alone, I&#8217;ve come to a number of conclusions about RubyMotion and Objective-C. Ultimately, RubyMotion is superior to Objective-C in almost every way, and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lrz">Laurent Sansonetti</a> must be some kind of mythical otherworldly genius to have developed something at once so usable and so powerful.</p>

<p>Why do I believe this? What makes RubyMotion so superior to straight-up Objective-C?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://github.com/Veraticus/Dynamoid">Dynamoid 0.4.0</a> is a pretty significant improvement over previous iterations of Dynamoid. While the project has obviously always been my hobby, 0.4.0 represents what I would consider one of the first iterations I would use in a real production application. Not because the previous version haven&#8217;t worked &#8211; they&#8217;ve all done exactly what they should do. But now it has the flexibility and options to really allow an application to thrive in Amazon&#8217;s DynamoDB.</p>

<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
