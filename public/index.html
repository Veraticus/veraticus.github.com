  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with <a href="http://www.consul.io/">consul</a>. At first glance, it&rsquo;s a bit like <a href="http://zookeeper.apache.org/">zookeeper</a> or <a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd">etcd</a> &mdash; it handles service discovery, health checking, and even features a very simple k/v store. But consul does much more than merely expose a lovely DNS interface: one of its more powerful features is its ability to do cluster orchestration, efficiently and effectively propagating messages to all nodes. One of my client projects runs on a dozen servers across two applications; here&rsquo;s how I integrated CircleCI, chef, and consul together to make any GitHub commit run a deploy only to the targeted application, without needing to know any application server&rsquo;s name or IP address.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been a few years since I last went to Windy City Rails, despite the fact that it&rsquo;s oh-so-convenient and there are so many high-quality Ruby and Rails developers in Chicago. I decided to go this year and, for those not able to come, provide small synopses of the presentations. So, without further ado, I present: Windy City Rails 2014, Day One.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So you want to become a programmer, huh?</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because President Obama <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY">told you to learn computer science</a>, and you&rsquo;re not gonna argue with the President.</p>

<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s because you hunger to make something &mdash; a product other people use &mdash; and you&rsquo;re tired of a job where, at the end of the day, you wonder what exactly you did or why it even mattered. And hey, making software is easier and cleaner than making furniture.</p>

<p>But realistically it&rsquo;s probably because of the money. Glassdoor claims that <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/software-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,17.htm">software engineers make a median salary of $85,000</a>, which is nothing to sneeze at. Even the lowliest programmers can look forward to taking home about $60k, and if you have a talent and drive for programming, then the only limit to your salary is your ambition.</p>

<p>All well and good. But how do you go from a casual smartphone owner and recreational computer user to actually making software? And then how do you turn making software into real money that appears in your wallet and bank account?</p>

<p>After my <a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2014/01/14/rails-consulting-for-fun-and-profit/">article on consulting in Rails</a>, easily the most-asked question I received was: &ldquo;How do I become a programmer, and what do I do when I get there?&rdquo; No one is born with a keyboard strapped to their hands: every programmer you know learned how to do it. I did too. Here I&rsquo;ll describe what I found most helpful for getting into programming, how I&rsquo;d do it again if I had to, and what you should keep in mind if you decide to set off on the programmer&rsquo;s path.</p>

<p>This post is extremely long. But hopefully by the end of it, you&rsquo;ll have some clear ideas and inspirations for how to turn yourself into a real, honest-to-goodness programmer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&rsquo;t usually call out articles on Hacker News for being exceptionally silly &mdash; if I did I wouldn&rsquo;t have the time to write about anything else &mdash; but I saw one in particular tonight that bugged me, titled <a href="http://www.andresosinski.com/you-job-is-not-to-code.html">Your Job Is Not To Code</a>. It was filled with the sort of engineering platitudes that one can reliably expect from HN: you must be an engineering ambassador to your company from the strange and incomprehensible Codingverse. It&rsquo;s up to you to interpret and reinterpret the requirements of your project, hopefully better than its stakeholders, and tell them what they&rsquo;re doing wrong. Your technical skills must be married to the sort of interpersonal skills that would make ambassadors and diplomats blush.</p>

<p>This is all bunk.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re an engineer, then your job is to code. Your job is to be good at it. No, more than that: your job is to be <strong>great</strong> at it. Anything less is a disservice to the people who&rsquo;ve hired you and a disservice to yourself. You should work constantly to succeed at your job. Working towards anything else is a distraction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As developers, we spend a lot of time in our shells: making them fast and responsive improves our productivity. I play around with a lot of development tools (as I mentioned in <a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2014/01/22/supercharge-your-rails-development-environment/">a previous post</a>) trying to find the best combination of intelligence, responsiveness, and fun. Recently I was investigating alternatives to <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a>, which is a wonderful set of Zsh packages but suffers from weird slowdowns and, unfortunately, requires a lot of configuration. I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto">prezto</a> and I love it &mdash; originally an optimized fork of oh-my-zsh, it&rsquo;s now its own project, and it is fast, beautiful, and leverages the full power of Zsh. It looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://veratic.us/image/300y2o0a3t03/screenie.png" alt="Terminal" /></p>

<p>You should get it. And when you do, use these configuration settings to make your experience even better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been creating a complicated OpsWorks server setup for a client, as I mentioned in <a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2014/05/09/creating-an-aws-opsworks-instance-store-ami/">my last post</a>, and I&rsquo;ve been really enjoying the process. OpsWorks, while still a beta service, has a lot to recommend itself: it couples the best parts of chef to the power of the impressive AWS APIs. Using OpsWorks, it&rsquo;s easy to make processes that seem almost magical.</p>

<p>How magical? Well, imagine super-fast command line deploys, seamless cookbook updates, great chatbot and application integration, then marry all those things to AWS autoscaling via elastic load balancing. One use case for my client: <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">TravisCI</a> automatically creating servers, running remote acceptance tests on them, then destroying them afterwards &mdash; all while notifying chatrooms of its progress. Now that&rsquo;s assurance your code will work in production! Really, the sky&rsquo;s the limit here for awesome integrations.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned a lot in the process of implementing this setup. If you&rsquo;re looking to give OpsWorks a go for your next project, here&rsquo;s some hints and tips to make get started on the right path.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a fair amount of work in Amazon&rsquo;s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/">OpsWorks</a>, in many ways an elegant service. Once you have a set of chef recipes provisioning properly, you&rsquo;ll want to create an AMI for the layer in question so that you don&rsquo;t have to wait through a long setup process again. Unfortunately, doing this in OpsWorks can be frustrating since the instructions for making it happen are scattered across <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workinginstances-custom-ami.html">four</a> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-instance-store.html">entirely</a> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/ec2-cli-get-set-up.html#install-ami-tools">different</a> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/set-up-ec2-cli-linux.html">documents</a>. For my own sanity I made a checklist of all the steps necessary to create an AMI on an instance store EC2 server: this is that checklist for anyone else who might find it useful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love trying to improve my development environment. Efficiency is important to me: I spend hours and hours a day programming, and even a 1% or 2% productivity boost would provide a massive time savings over the course of a year. Or, as xkcd so pithily put it:</p>

<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/1205/"><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png" alt="Is It Worth The Time?" /></a></p>

<p>Of course, I&rsquo;ve probably obliterated any potential savings by spending so much time experimenting, but now that I&rsquo;ve done it you don&rsquo;t have to! Listed here is everything important to me to get my development environment zipping along. Hopefully you&rsquo;ll be able to find something useful here too that makes your programming experiences a little bit faster.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my <a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2014/01/14/rails-consulting-for-fun-and-profit/">previous post</a>, I told the story of how I accidentally fell into consulting and turned it into a successful business. But what does a successful consulting business &mdash; specifically, <strong>my</strong> successful consulting business &mdash; actually look like?</p>

<p><a href="http://symondsandson.com">Symonds &amp; Son</a> isn&rsquo;t named to sound cute and hipstery. I&rsquo;m the son; I&rsquo;m in business with my father, and I recently hired my mother to be my assistant and bookkeeper. The company&rsquo;s name is intended to evoke images of traditional, reliable family businesses, where trust, excellence, and a reputation for quality products are their cornerstones. These companies, traditionally centered around carpentry and other hand-made professions, are my models for how to run Symonds &amp; Son. We are, if you&rsquo;ll forgive me using the phrase, a bespoke development shop, where our great output and superb relationship with our clients are our highest priorities.</p>

<p>But building my profession into a company &mdash; and a company with my parents, no less &mdash; hasn&rsquo;t been an easy road. There have been a lot of compromises we&rsquo;ve had to make to get this ship sailing straight. Here, I&rsquo;ll speak to how I made this new parent/child relationship work&hellip; and how I hope to continue making it work for years to come.</p>
